Hello everybody,
can you hear me back there?
good.

Welcome to Programming Systems,
I'm Alberto Cortes,
I'll be teaching you this term.

There is a web page for this course,

http://it.uc3m.es/alcortes/asig/1415/ps-ging

you should all check it out,
because, there you will find all there is to know about this course,
from administrative staff
to the core materials you need to study to pass this course.




I'll go over some of the general course information now.

Let's see what do you need to write a good book

1) you need to be able to read and write in english

2) you need some book writing skills:

   - story telling

   - developing interesting characters

   - some real world experiences

   - lots of reading on your own

   - ...

Many 10 year old kids knows how to read and write in English,
even better than me,
but few have the right writing skills to write interesting books.

Well, we have the same problem with programming.

What do you need to code good programs:

1) you need to be able to read and write in a programming language

Java for example, you already know Java from the first term.

2) you need some programming skills

we are not going to learn Java in this course,
we are going to learn important skills for programming,
and we will be using Java in our examples.

Any questions about this?




So what important skills are we going to learn:

- We are going to learn about Object Oriented programming, which is a way to
  organize data and operations in your programs, which is quite popular
  nowadays.

- We are going to learn how graphical user interfaces work, because a good
  deal of software today uses graphics, windows, buttons, all that kind of
  graphical stuff...

- We are going to learn about recursion, which is a nice way to solve some
  complicated problems in a simple way, and is used a lot in programming

- And finallly, we are going to learn aobut some data structures, like lists,
  queues, stacks, and trees. These are special ways to store data
inside a computer, so you can access and use those data later in very quick
ways.

The nice thing about this course, is that all these topics can be used with
any programming language, not just Java. So you will be able to use all this
tools in the future, no matter what programming language you use.

Any questions about this?




This is how we are going to organize the classes:

(show calendar)

each week, we will be having a lecture, on fridays, which is a class between 1
teacher and about 40 students in a room without computers.

each week, we will be also having a lab, which is class between 1 or more
teachers and about 20 students, in a room full of computers, like this one.

In fact, today is officially a lab, but a very special one as this is the
first class after all.

There are some important events marked in red, in the calendar, that is, the
exams.

There are also some green markings, meaning those classes are not in
the usual day of the week or they are not at the usual hours, so be carefull
not to miss them.

OK, any questions so far?






Now, about the teachers:

(show teaching staff)

This is me, Alberto, I'll be teaching you all the lectures
and I'm also going to be the lab teacher for groups 65, 69 and 79.

Here you can find my web page, with all the details about how to get in touch
with me, including how to ask me for tutorials and how to ask me technical
questions.

There is another teacher: Alicia, over there.
She will be the lab teacher for group 95.

Any questions about this?






In the main web page of the course, you will also find the materials you have
to study:

- For lectures: there is going to be bibliographic references to selected
  books. This will be your main source of information for this course.

  Here I have phisical copies of the three more important books. If i were to
  buy a book for this course, my favorite one is this one. You can check them
  all during the break.

  This ohter book is also interesting, it is NOT a very good book, and it
  is freely available online.

- I'm giving you also the slides used by teachers in past editions of this
  course. Personally, I will not be using slides to teach you this course, but
  you can use them anyway, if you want to.

  I recommend you to use the books, instead of the slides, though.

- For the labs, there are the lab scripts, with exercises to solve in
  pairs in front of a computer. We will be publishing the solutions to these
  lab scripts a week after each lab.

- We are also going to publish self-assessment exercises for each lecture.
  Some of these exercises will be easier than the labs, some will be harder,
  so I recommend you to start working on them as soon as the lecture has finish,
  and maybe finish them after the lab. So they are kind of a weekly homework
  for you.

- We are not going to publish the solution to this self-assessment exercises,
  instead we encourage you to use the course forum, available through Aula
  Global, to ask questions there.

- The forum is a tool for students, and by students, meaning we, the teachers,
  are not going to answer questions there, nor are we going to correct wrong
  answers by other students, just like in the real world, forums can be
  dangerous, they are also very useful, but dangerous.

- There is also going to be some optional resources, like readings and videos,
  to complement the lectures. This resources are marked optional, because they
  will not be used for the exams.

Any questions about that?




Now let's talk about grading

Your overall grade will be computed as follows:

- 25% will come from your midterm 1 exam

- another 25% will come from your midterm 2 exam

- and a final 50% will come from your final exam.

To pass this course you'll need an overall grade above 5.0.

On top of this, in the ordinary call, you will need a minimum score of 3.5 in
the final exam to pass this course.

Here you will find more details about our grading system.

Please note that the only thing that matters to pass this course are the
exams: the two midterms and final. Class attendance is not required, lab
attendance is not required, you won't be submitting any labs or exercises and
there is not going to be a project to submit at the end of this course.

Any questions about this?




How does an Exam looks like?

All exams will have two parts:

- first, a test, worth 30% of the score. All the materials we have been
  talking about before can be part of this test.

- then, some problems, worth 70% of the score. These problems will be similar
  to the lab scripts we have been talking before.

And that's all for the intro.

Any questions?
