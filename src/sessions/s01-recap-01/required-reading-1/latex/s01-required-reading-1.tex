We will be using Linux in this course as the main programming environment.
Most student use Linux dailly, in their phones and tablets, but few have prior
experience on using Linux as a programming environment.

This document is a short guide to learn the basics, it contains a few short
explanations and some interesting links to external resources.

Disclaimer: The authors of the resources linked in this document are not
involved with this course in any way. As you are first year students, with few
online experience, please don't bother them with your questions, ask the
course teaching staff instead.

\section{Connecting to your Linux account}

A Linux account should have been created for you when you first got into the
University on your first term.

The authentication credentials to log into your Linux account are the same as
for your Windows account.

There are two ways to login:

\begin{enumerate}

  \item \textbf{Connecting to your Linux account at the lab}:

  If you are seated at a computer in the labs you can log into your Linux
  account using the following procedure:

  \begin{enumerate}

    \item Boot into Linux: all computers in the labs are configured to
      dual-boot into Linux or Windows. If the computer is currently runing
      Windows, just reboot it and choose Linux at the boot menu.

    \item Log into your account: after the boot process has completed, you
      will be asked for a login name and a password. Enter the same login and
      password as for your student Windows account.

    \item Logging out: Once you have finished working, remember to log out from
      your account using a graphical menu you will find in your desktop manager
      (details on how to do this depend on the actual desktop manager you are
      running). There is no need to reboot the computer back into Windows
      before you leave.

  \end{enumerate}

  \item \textbf{Connecting to your Linux account from outside the lab}:

  You can work on your Linux account remotely, connecting from home, a
  cafeteria, a library, etc.

  You will find remote connections useful while working on this course on
  weekends, outside of class hours, etc.

  To connect to your Linux account remotely follow this procedure:

  \begin{enumerate}

    \item Install an SSH client for your Operating System. You can find more
      information about SSH
      \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell}{here}.

      If you are running Windows, I recommend using
      \href{http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html}{PuTTY}.

      If you are using Linux or Mac, there is a great chance you
      already have an SSH client installed in your computer, the program is
      called ``\texttt{ssh}''. If this program is not already installed, just
      install it.

    \item Connect to the SSH server of the University: Use your SSH client of
      choice to connect to the SSH server of the University at
      ``\texttt{linux.aig.uc3m.es}'' (port is 23).

      Make sure the fingerprint of the server you are connecting to is:

      \begin{center}
        \texttt{e9:98:4d:37:18:07:53:eb:33:3b:06:8d:c5:40:c2:f7}
      \end{center}

      otherwise drop your connection inmediately, as you are probably suffering
      a
      \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attackman-in-the-middle}
      man-in-the-middle attack.

      You can personally verify the fingerprint of the University SSH server at
      room 1.1.J07 during working hours, if you think this document has been
      compromised as part of the attack.

      On a successful connection attemp you will be
      welcomed with a message from the Linux admins, like in this example:

\begin{blackboard}
alcortes@bat:~$ ssh linux.aig.uc3m.es
alcortes@linux.aig.uc3m.es's password: 

       Bienvenido a Aulas Informáticas Generales
          Universidad Carlos III de Madrid

          Puede contactar con nosotros en:
     
                gsai@aig.uc3m.es

Last login: Tue Jan 13 13:53:33 2015 from bat.it.uc3m.es
alcortes@linux:~$
\end{blackboard}

    \item Logging out: Once you have finished working, you can log out from
      your account by exitting from your login shell with the ``\texttt{exit}''
      command.

  \end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}


You can find more information about your Linux account at

Informáticas - UC3M - Linux} (sorry, only in Spanish).

\section{Linux as a Programming Environment}

The hardest part of learning to use Linux as a programming environment is
learning how to use the Command Line.

You will find a nice introducction to the Linux command line
\href{http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_learning_the_shell.php#contents}{here}.

There is also a very good book about this topic: "The Unix Programming
Environment," by Brian W. Kernighan and Rob Pike, published by Prentice-Hall.
Unix and Linux are two different operating systems, altough so similar on how
they work as a programming environment that this book is very useful for
learning both of them.


\section{Working with Java in Linux}

To work with Java in Linux you will need at least three kind of programs:

\begin{enumerate}

  \item \textbf{A good text editor}: You will spend most of your time in this
    course writting programs, so you will need a good (programming) text
    editor.

    I recommend you to learn either Vim or Emacs. They are both very powerful
    programming text editors, well documented and widely used by programmers
    everywhere. They are also already installed in the Linux University
    servers.

    You can learn how to use the Vim editor by reading this
    \href{ftp://ftp.vim.org/pub/vim/doc/book/vimbook-OPL.pdf}{guide} or by
    using the command \texttt{vimtutor}.  You can learn to use the Emacs editor
    by reading this \href{http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/tour/}{guide}.

    In case you don't want to learn Vim or Emacs, you can use any other text
    editor you like, at your own risk.

    We will not be using IDEs (like Eclipse, for example) in this course as
    they will slow your learning process and has been responsible for 50\% of
    student fails in the past (this a personal appreciation).

  \item \textbf{A Java Compiler}: There is already a Java compiler installed in
    the Linux servers called \texttt{javac}.

    \begin{blackboard}
alcortes@linux:~$ javac -version
javac 1.7.0_13
\end{blackboard}

  \item \textbf{A Java Virtual Machine}: There is a Java Virtual Machine
    installed in the Linux servers called \texttt{java}.

    \begin{blackboard}
alcortes@linux:~$ java -version
java version "1.7.0_13"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_13-b20)
Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 23.7-b01, mixed mode)
\end{blackboard}


\end{enumerate}
