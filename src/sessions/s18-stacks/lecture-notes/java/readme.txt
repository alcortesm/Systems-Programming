- Stack.java
- ArrayStack.java
- LinkedStack.java

  Stack interface and alcortes' reference array and linked list
  implementations.

- StackTest.java

  A test program to test your (or mine) implementations.

  You must run the program using and argument: A for testing your array
  implementation or L for testing your linked list implementation.

  The program will finish silently if no errors are found, but will print an
  error number if one or more errors are found. You can read its source code
  to learn what the errors are about, to help you debug your implementation.

  All the implementations have to have a toString() method for the testing.

  The toString() method for stacks will return a string with the following
  format:

      Stack {(top)}
      Stack {A, B, C, D (top)}




- Queue.java
- ArrayQueue.java
- LinkedQueue.java

  Queue interface and alcortes' reference array and linked list
  implementations.

- QueueTest.java

  A test program to test your (or mine) implementations, similar to StactTest.

  The toString() method for queues will return a string with the following
  format:

      Queue {(front)}
      Queue {A, B, C, D (front)}





- Deque.java
- ArrayDeque.java
- LinkedDeque.java

  Deque interface and alcortes' reference array and linked list
  implementations.

- DequeTest.java

  A test program for deques, similar to StackTest.

  This program also accepts a second parameter (D), to output debug
  information about the testing process.

  The toString() method for queues will return a string with the following
  format:

      Deque {(head) (tail)}
      Deque {(head) A, B, C, D (tail)}
