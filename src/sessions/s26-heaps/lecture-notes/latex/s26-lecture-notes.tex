\section{Priority Queues}

You already know about queues: queues are a standard way to process objects on
a \emph{first-come, first-served} scheduling, for example, clients in a store.

However, for many problems, some ``clients'' are more important than others:

\begin{itemize}

  \item Passengers waitting to board a plane, often first class passengers are
    going to board before Business class passengers, no matter how late they
    get into the airport.

  \item Your agenda is a collection of tasks that usually come in in a random
    order, but you usually start working on the most urgent task (this is, the
    task with the highest priority), no matter how late this task got into your
    agenda.

  \item An Internet router is constantly receiving data packages from all
    around the world, but it serves the packets with the highest priority
    first.

  \item Any real time simulation program, including most games: the game is
    constantly creating new events that will happend in the close future, they
    are being stored in a priority queue, so the most urgent event is simulated
    first. In this case the priority of an event is how close does it have to
    happen.

    Example: in a multiplayer game: several people are giving commands to the
    game, in which order are this commands going to happen? (begins casting a
    spell, another throw an arrow, does the arrow hit before the spell is
    cast?)

\end{itemize}

So the main operations on a priority queue are:

\subsection{The Heap Data Structure}

A binary heap is a binary tree with two properties:

\begin{enumerate}

  \item The \emph{shape} property: The tree is complete.

    This means the tree has the minimum possible height for its number of
    elements ($h = \lfloor log_{2} n \rfloor$).

    The excellent performance of this data structure comes from this property:
    contrary to binary search trees, there are not ``unbalanced'' heaps.

    This is also the reason why we use array based trees for heaps instead of
    trees based in linked nodes (more on this later).

  \item The \emph{heap order} property: For every node, its priority is $\ge$ than the
    priority of its children, if any.

    This means the node with the highest priority is always the root of the tree.

\end{enumerate}

\begin{center}

  \includegraphics[width=7cm]{./img/is_heap/is_heap-02.eps}
  \includegraphics[width=7cm]{./img/is_heap/is_heap-03.eps}
  \includegraphics[width=7cm]{./img/is_heap/is_heap-04.eps}
\end{center}

\begin{blackboard}
  is this tree a binary heap?

  yes, no
  no, yes
\end{blackboard}

\subsection{Insert Algorithm}

The insert algorithm has two parts:

\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{enumerate}

  \item Place the new node at the end of the complete tree.

    With the tree already complies with the \emph{shape} property, but probably
    not with the \emph{heap order} property.

  \item If the priority of your parent is smaller than yours, swap possitions
    with the parent. Repeat until the heap property is meet.

    This will fix the \emph{heap order} property eventually, without breaking
    the \emph{shape} property, as swapping does not modify the shape of the
    tree.

\end{enumerate}
\columnbreak
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=8cm]{./img/insert/insert.eps}
\end{center}
\end{multicols}

\newpage
\subsection{RemoveMax Algorithm}

\begin{multicols}{2}

The root element is always the element with the maximum priority, therefore, we
do not have to search for it.

But once we extract it, the tree is broken, as it has not root.

To recover the tree shape, we have to choose one other node to substitute the root.

The best way to do that while mantaining the \emph{shape} property is to choose
the last node in the tree, and move it to the root.

This way the shape property is mantained.

The heap order property is not probably broken, but we can easily fix that by swapping:

If the priority of the node is smaller than any of its children, then swap with
the child with the biggest priority. Repeat until the heap property is meet.

\begin{enumerate}

  \item Return root, move las node to root.

  \item If priority of the node is smaller than any of its children,
    swap with the biggest child. Repeat until the heap property is meet.

\end{enumerate}
\columnbreak

  \includegraphics[width=8cm]{./img/removeMax/removeMax.eps}
\end{center}
\end{multicols}


\subsection{Binary Heap Implementation}

As a binary heap is a binary tree, we can reuse the last week implementation of
a binary tree, with node that have parent, left and right references.

But since binary heaps are complete binary trees, it is much more simpler to
just use an array imlementation of a binary tree.

Do you remember the array imlementation of a binary tree from two weeks ago?

It looked like this:

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=12cm]{../../../s22-trees/lecture-notes/latex/img/arraybtree/arraybtree.eps}
\end{center}

So let us implement a binary heap using an array:

\codeinput{../java/PriorityQueue.java}{PriorityQueue.java}
\codeinput{../java/Heap.java}{Heap.java}
