\section{Today's Topics}
\begin{blackboard}
Trees
\end{blackboard}

\section{Graphs}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=10cm]{./img/graph/graph4.eps}
\end{center}

A graph is a set of \emph{nodes} connected by \emph{edges} (that in computer science we call \emph{links}).

Graphs are a very powerful way to store information and relationships,
but they are complex to study.

Examples of graphs can be the connections between computers in a network or a set of friends in Facebook.

We are not going to study graphs in this course,
-- SLIDE --
but you have already study a \emph{particular} and very simple type of graph: the \emph{list}.

-- SLIDE --

When in a graph there is only one path to get from any node to any other node, it is called a \emph{tree}.

We are not going to study trees in this course either,
but we are going to study rooted trees for the rest of the course.

-- SLIDE --

A \emph{rooted tree} is a tree with an special node, called the \emph{root}.

The root is usually important for your problem for some reason that depends on the problem.

The choice of a root impose an order in the tree.
The root A is the parent of B and C, which are the children of A.

Please note that the rooted tree in the picture is the same graph as the tree above,
it has the same nodes with the same edges between them,
I just move the nodes around to show in a clear way that the node A is somewhat special for me.

Rooted trees are not as powerful as graphs for representing information,
but they much simpler, which makes them a very popular data structure.

For the rest of this course, when I say tree, I am really refering to a rooted tree.


\section{Examples of trees}

Do you remember the recursive and horrible solution to the Fibonacci problem?

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=6cm]{./img/fibonacci/fibonacci.eps}
\end{center}

This is obviously a tree.

In conputer science trees grow downwards,
the root is at the top and the \emph{leaves} are at the buttom,
we are that weird.

\separator

Do you remember the object inheritance hierarchy in Java?

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=6cm]{./img/object/object.eps}
\end{center}

Well, this is also a tree.

That is why we sometimes say parent instead of superclass and child instead of subclass.

Let us take a look at some of the directories I have under my music directory:

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=8cm]{./img/music/music.eps}
\end{center}

This might not look as a tree, but if you look closely, you will see it is, in
fact, a tree, with the music directory as the root, then, on the first level
the name of the bands, and on the second level the name of the albums.

Problem: Write a graphical Java program that allows me to browse my music collection
by bands and albums and let me play songs by clicking on them.

\separator

Now, let us take a look at this map of flight routes through Europe:

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=5cm]{./img/map/map.eps}
\end{center}

Problem: Write a Java program that finds the flight with least connections from Madrid to Rome.

You can create the tree of flights from Madrid to Rome, and look for the path
with least connections (this is edges or links).

This is, you have to find the sortest path
or the leaf with the smallest \emph{depth}.

\begin{center}

\end{center}

The Knapsack problem.

You are a burglar, stealing some goods in a house.

You carry a bag that can hold up to 95 Kilograms of goods.

In the house there are 4 objects, each of them with its own weight and price:

\begin{blackboard}
      w  p
  A  50 60
  B  20 30
  C  30 66
  D  40 40
\end{blackboard}

Write a Java program that calculates the best way to fill your bag.

This is, find the combination of goods, that maximize the total price while keeping the weight smaller or equal than 95.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=13cm]{./img/knapsack/knapsack.eps}
\end{center}

A naive algorithm to solve this problem might look as follows:

\begin{blackboard}
  - build the tree with all the combinations (weight <= 95)
  - search for the leaf with the biggest price
\end{blackboard}

Now, think of Amazon, sending boxes to Madrid from Paris in a plane, trying to
fill the boxes the best way possible.

Of course Amazon will have thousands of goods and there might be 20 or more flight connections.

All these are toy examples of real programming problems that happens every day in

\begin{itemize}
  \item Computer graphics
  \item Compresion of video, images and music
  \item Optimization problems (in airports, storehouses, filesystems, companies)
  \item Marketing
  \item Economics
  \item Sequencing the human gnome
  \item Internet communications
  \item ...
\end{itemize}

As you can see, trees are pretty useful data structures.


\newpage

\section{Definition}

Until now, you have been using \emph{linear} data structures, like lists, queues, stacks and decks.

In a linear data structure each element has a clear predecessor and a clear succesor.

Trees are non-linear data structures that store elements in a hierarchy.

Each element (except the root) has a parent.

Each element (except the leafs) has one or more children.

\subsection{Implementations}

There are two main ways to implement binary trees:

\begin{itemize}

  \item as an array

  \item as linked nodes

\end{itemize}

\subsection{ArrayBTree}

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=14cm]{./img/arraybtree/arraybtree.eps}
\end{center}

This imlementation is only useful for complete trees,
because otherwise we are wasting a lot of memory.

In our next class we will study some interesting cases of complete trees,
and we will come back to this implementation again.

But for now, let us learn a more efficient implementation for generic
non-complete trees.


\subsection{LinkedBTree}

As a binary tree is ordered, we can not use the complicated or the simple
implementation for the generic linked tree, because it will be impossible to
define nodes with only a right child.

Thankfully, the solution is pretty simple for binary trees, as they have a
constant number of childs, just use a left link and a right link directly.

\includegraphics[width=4cm]{./img/linkedbnode/linkedbnode1.eps}
\includegraphics[width=4cm]{./img/linkedbnode/linkedbnode2.eps}
\includegraphics[width=4cm]{./img/linkedbnode/linkedbnode3.eps}
\includegraphics[width=4cm]{./img/linkedbnode/linkedbnode4.eps}
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=12cm]{./img/linkedbnode/linkedbnode5.eps}
\end{center}

The \texttt{LinkedBNode} definition and constructors looks like this:

\codelinesinput{../java/LinkedBNode.java}{LinkedBNode}{1}{21}

The \texttt{isInternal} check is

\codelinesinput{../java/LinkedBNode.java}{LinkedBNode}{23}{25}

Problem: Write an implementation for the \texttt{depth} method?

\codelinesinput{../java/LinkedBNode.java}{LinkedBNode}{27}{29}

Problem: Write an implementation for the \texttt{size} method?

\codelinesinput{../java/LinkedBNode.java}{LinkedBNode}{31}{35}

Problem: Write an implementation for the \texttt{height} method?

\codelinesinput{../java/LinkedBNode.java}{LinkedBNode}{37}{41}

A \texttt{LinkedBTree} has only two important block of code:

\begin{itemize}

  \item Its definition and constructors:

    \codelinesinput{../java/LinkedBTree.java}{LinkedBTree}{1}{31}

  \item and a way to insert small trees into other trees to make big trees.

    This one is tricky, as we want to reuse the nodes from the previous tree
    when inserting, so we can make this method fast.

    But this means we have to remove the nodes from the tree being inserted to
    avoid having nodes that belong to several trees at the same time.

    \codelinesinput{../java/LinkedBTree.java}{LinkedBTree}{40}{66}

    There is an equivalent \texttt{insertRight} method.

\end{itemize}

Problem: build the following tree:

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=12cm]{./img/treeexample/treeexample.eps}
\end{center}


\subsection{Tree traversals}

A traversal is a way to visit all the nodes in a graph, for example for
printing them or for searching or for doing some other operation on them.

In a list, there is only two reasonable ways to visit its nodes,
for example to print them
or to search for a node
or to sum the contents of the nodes,
this either from left to right or from right to left.

But in a tree, there are 4 different ways:

\input{traversals.tex}

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=12cm]{./img/traversals/traversals.eps}
\end{center}


\subsubsection{PreOrder}

The recursive version is very simple:

\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{blackboard}
      PRE_ORDER

// LinkedBNode
void printPreOrder() {
  s.o.p(datum);
  if (left != null) {
    left.printPreOrder();
  }
  if (right != null) {
    right.printPreOrder();
  }
}
\end{blackboard}
\columnbreak
\includegraphics[width=5cm]{./img/preorder/preorder.eps}
\end{multicols}

The iterative version is more complex:

\begin{blackboard}
      PRE_ORDER ITERATIVE

// LinkedBTree
void printPreOrder() {
  if (isEmpty()) {
    return;
  }
  Stack<LinkedBNode<E>> stack =
                   new Stack<LinkedBNode<E>>();
  stack.push(root);
  root.printPreOrder(stack);
}

// LinkedBNode
void printPreOrder(Stack<LinkedBNode<E> stack) {
  while (! stack.isEmpty()) {
    LinkedBNode<E> current = stack.pop();
    System.out.println(current.datum);
    if (current.right != null) {
      stack.push(current.right);
    }
    if (current.left != null) {
      stack.push(current.left);
    }
  }
}
\end{blackboard}

\subsection{PostOrder}

The recursive version is simple:

\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{blackboard}
      POST_ORDER

// LinkedBNode
void printPostOrder() {
  if (left != null) {
    left.printPostOrder();
  }
  if (right != null) {
    right.printPostOrder();
  }
  s.o.p(datum);
}
\end{blackboard}
\columnbreak
\includegraphics[width=5cm]{./img/postorder/postorder.eps}
\end{multicols}

\subsection{InOrder}

The recursive version is simple:

\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{blackboard}
      IN_ORDER

// LinkedBNode
void printInOrder() {
  if (left != null) {
    left.printInOrder();
  }
  s.o.p(datum);
  if (right != null) {
    right.printInOrder();
  }
}
\end{blackboard}
\columnbreak
\includegraphics[width=5cm]{./img/inorder/inorder.eps}
\end{multicols}

\newpage
\subsection{LevelOrder}

The recursive version is very complex.

But the iterative version is very simple:

\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{blackboard}
      LEVEL_ORDER ITERATIVE

// LinkedBTree
void printLevelOrder() {
  if (isEmpty()) {
    return;
  }
  Queue<LinkedBNode<E>> queue =
                   new Queue<LinkedBNode<E>>();
  queue.enqueue(root);
  root.printLevelOrder(queue);
}

// LinkedBNode
void printLevelOrder(Queue<LinkedBNode<E>> queue) {
  while (! queue.isEmpty()) {
    LinkedBNode<E> current = queue.dequeue();
    System.out.println(current.datum);
    if (current.left != null) {
      queue.enqueue(current.left);
    }
    if (current.right != null) {
      queue.enqueue(current.right);
    }
  }
}
\end{blackboard}
\columnbreak
\includegraphics[width=5cm]{./img/levelorder/levelorder.eps}
\end{multicols}
