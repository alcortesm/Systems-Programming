A \emph{binary} tree is an \underline{ordered} tree, where all its nodes have $<3$ children
(this is, nodes can have 0, 1, or 2 children).

A non-empty binary tree is \emph{complete} when
\begin{itemize}
\item all its levels except possibly the last one are full,
\item and the last level has all its nodes on the left side.
\end{itemize}

A non-empty binary tree is \emph{full} when each node is either a leaf or has
exactly 2 children.
