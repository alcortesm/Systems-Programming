\section{Problem 1}

GIVE 10 MINUTES TO READ THE PROBLEM TEXT.

THEN YOU WILL HAVE TO EXPLAIN WHAT IS THE PROBLEM ASKING IN ABOUT 2
PARRAGRAPHS.


\subsection{Discussion}

Problem description:
\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{itemize}
  \item You should be able to create houses and shops, from their description
    (area, age, rooms\ldots) and be able to calculate the IBI and TRU of each
    one.

    For this, you need a \texttt{Housing} class, a \texttt{Establishment} class
    and a \texttt{CityCouncilTaxes} interface.
\end{itemize}

\columnbreak

\begin{itemize}
  \item You should be able to proccess several buildings at once and generate
    some statistics: average IBI and maximum TRU.

    For this, you need an \texttt{Estate} class.

\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=14cm]{./img/estate-advanced/estate-advanced.eps}
\end{center}

WARNINGS: Size reduction of classes, protected \texttt{age}, common part of
\texttt{calculateIBI()} in the abstract class.

\newpage


Interesting things:

\begin{itemize}

  \item This problem deals with money, so probably most attributes should be
    \texttt{BigDecimal}. As you alredy know we usually do not use
    \texttt{BigDecimal}s in the exams, to save time and for better readability
    of your answers.

  \item Usually you should never implement the age of something as an int,
    because if you execute this program in a year from know, all the ages will
    be wrong. It is much better to use the classes \texttt{Date} or
    \texttt{Calendar} that are Java classes especifically designed to represent
    a moment of time. The age of something will be the date of today minus the
    date of its birthday.

    Despite that, we still use ints for age in the exams to save time and for
    simplicity.

\end{itemize}


Test program:

Let us create a program to test our solution to this problem, first, let us see
if we understand the problem by filling the blanks in this table:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|l|c|c|}
  \hline
  Estate & Properties & IBI & TRU \\
  \hline
  h1     & Housing, 5 years, 100 $m^{2}$, 1 room & \textbf{1200} & \textbf{15} \\
  h2     & Housing, 10 years, 100 $m^{2}$, 3 rooms & \textbf{1000} & \textbf{45} \\
  e1     & Establishment, 15 years, 100 $m^{2}$, 1 m long & \textbf{1100} & \textbf{20} \\
  e2     & Establishment, 20 years, 100 $m^{2}$, 2 m long & \textbf{1000} & \textbf{40} \\
  \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Now, let us write a program to test this and the print method from the last section of the problem:

\subsection{Section 3}

\begin{multicols}{2}
Pay attention to:

\begin{itemize}

  \item What is the best class to place the static method?

  \item Bad input argument (null array)

  \item Beware of arrays with holes!.

  \item Avoid traversing the array twice (calculate the average and
    the max in a single run).

  \item Do not call \emph{calculate} methods more than once, they may be slow!
    (not the case of this example, but this is a very good rule of thumb).

  \item Assing and compare in a single line, super common idiom!

  \item Division by ZERO!

\end{itemize}

\end{multicols}


\subsection{Using a List Instead of an Array}

\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{itemize}

  \item As size is known from the beginning, exceptions can be thrown at the
    beginning.


  \item (getting vs. removing) Emptying the list would be faster than getting
    (for a linked list), unless you know about \emph{iterators} (more on this
    later), but please do not do it, I may want to use my list later for
    something!

  \item There is no need to check for holes in the array if the array does not
    allow for nulls. No need for the estateCounter either.

  \item Do not divide in each iteration, wait until the end for efficiency.

  \item List implemented with linked nodes are expensive to traverse, avoid
    \texttt{get}ting elements more than once in each iteration of the loop.

    If you want to learn a more efficient way of solving this issue, please do
    some research on \emph{iterators}, they are quite awesome!.

\section{Problem 2}

GIVE 10 MINUTES TO READ THE PROBLEM TEXT.

THEN YOU WILL HAVE TO EXPLAIN WHAT IS THIS PROBLEM ASKING IS ABOUT 2 PARRAGRAPHS.


\subsection{Discussion}

Data structure description:

\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{enumerate}

  \item You have a tree that represents a family tree. Each \texttt{Tree} is a
    person (\texttt{String name}).

  \item Each person can have several children, for example, the children of Dís were Fíli and Kíli.

  \item Children are represented as a collections of trees (this is, a
    collection of people). In this problem we are going to use a
    \texttt{Queue<Tree>}, and we have called that a \texttt{Forest}, because it
    is a collection of trees.

    Fíli and Kíli have no children so they have empty queues (or empty forests).

  \item But Dís has 2 children, so he has a non-empty queue\ldots

  \item With its corresponding nodes.

\end{enumerate}

\columnbreak

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=8cm]{./img/family-tree/family-tree-05.eps}
\end{center}

\end{multicols}

Problem description:

\begin{itemize}

  \item You should be able to create people (trees) and their children (queue
    of other people).

  \item You should be able to print a person, which will print all its family
    tree.

\end{itemize}


Interesting things:

\begin{itemize}

  \item I have change the name of the tree attribute from \texttt{forest} to
    \texttt{children}, because it is a much better name.

  \item I have change the attributes of the queue, from \texttt{top} and
    \texttt{tail} to \texttt{first} and \texttt{last}, because it is a much
    better name, not only for a generic queue, but also for a collections of
    children, as the firstborn is now pointed by \texttt{first}, and the last
    child is pointed by \texttt{last}, so the naming now makes sense.

  \item According to these, there is an error in the problem text, Thorin was 5
    year younger than Frerin, so it should be on the left in the problem
    diagram, but that is not very important.

  \item Please notice that none of the two main classes (\texttt{Tree} and
    \texttt{Forest}) are \emph{generic} classes.

    The info of the trees are strings, and the forest is not a generic queue,
    it is a queue of trees, thus its name.
