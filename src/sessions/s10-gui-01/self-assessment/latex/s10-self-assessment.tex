\subsection{}

Create a graphical application with a text area on the center and 4 buttons
on its right. The buttons must be arranged vertically.

\section{}

\subsection{}

Create a graphical application that resembles a TV remote, with buttons
arranged in a grid. Modify the default layout of the content pane so it is no
longer a \verb+BorderLayout+, but a \verb+GridLayout+, so you can add buttons
to the content pane directly to get them arranged in a grid.


\section{}

\subsection{}

Create a graphical application that shows some \verb+JRadioButtons+. They must
behave correctly, so when you select one, the rest of them get unselected.
