<h1>Exam Instructions for Students</h1>

<p>These are general exam instructions, follow them in all the exams of this
course unless stated otherwise.</p>

<p>The teachers expect you to know and follow this instructions, so read them carefully.</p>




<h2>Things You Will Need During the Exam</h2>

<p>These are the things you will need for the exam:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Your DNI or National Identity Card (no DNI, no exam).</li>

  <li>A blue pen (better bring some spare blue pens with you, but do not bring
  a pencil case).</li>

  <li>A simple watch (if you want to keep track of the time).</li>

</ul>

<p>Everything that is not needed is prohibited, for example here is a list of
things you cannot have during an exam:</p>

<ul>
  
  <li>Mobile phones or computers.</li>

  <li>Pencils or non-blue pens.</li>

  <li>Ink erasers, sticky tape.</li>

  <li>Food (you are allowed a bottle of water and tissues, though).</li>

  <li>Sheets of paper.</li>

  <li>Backpacks, shoulder bags, pencil cases, glasses cases...</li>

  <li>Books or other written materials.</li>

</ul>

<p>(If you have some special medical needs, just explain them to a teacher when
entering the exam room).</p>





<h2>Before the Exam</h2>

<p>Check the course schedule carefully. Make sure you know the time and room for
the exam.</p>

<p>The exam begins at the specified time, sharp. My advise is to arrive at
least 10 minutes before the exam is due to start. If you arrive late, you will
not be allowed into the exam.</p>

<p>Ensure that you use the washroom before arriving to the exam.</p>




<h2>During the Exam</h2>

<p>Wait outside the room until we call your name, then enter the room and leave
your belongings (backpacks, mobile phones, coats...) at the front of the class
(just under the blackboard, in plain sight) and wait there until you are
assigned a seat.</p>

<p>Make sure your mobile phone is switched off. If your phone rings during the
exam you will get a -1 in the overall score and your classmates will hate you
forever.</p>

<p>Once you are assigned a seat, sit there and do not move.</p>

<p>Once you have entered the room, you will not be able to leave until about an
hour later or you will be graded as "NP" (<i>no presentado</i>). Once you leave
the room you will not be able to enter it again.</p>

<p><b>Do not turn over exam papers until told to do so</b>.</p>

<p>If you have any question or need a new exam booklet, raise your hand and a
teacher will come to you. Teachers will not give hints or answers, so please
do not waste your time asking for them.</p>

<p>Keep your eyes on your paper. Copying will be severely punished.</p>

<p>Talking is not allowed at any time in the exam room.</p>

<p>No extra pages will be provided for rough work. Everything you write on the
exam booklet will be evaluated. Draw a line through rough work or other notes
not considered part of your answer.</p>

<p><b>Stop writing immediately when the teacher says it is the end of the
  exam</b>.  This is extremely important, teachers will not give you a second
warning, they will simply (and silently) not collect your exam if they has seen
you writing after the time is due, and you will be graded an overall "NP"
(<i>no presentado</i>).</p>

<p>If you finish the exam early, just raise your hand and a teacher will collect
your exam, then leave the room quickly and quietly. Do not forget to collect
your belongings before you go.</p>

<p>Unless stated otherwise, midterm exams extend for 2 hours. Ordinary and
extraordinary exams extend for 4 hours.</p>






<h2>After the Exam</h2>

<p>Leave the exam room quickly and quietly and do not wait near the exam room
for your classmates, just leave the building, as you will be talking too loud,
bothering students still in the exam and other classes nearby.</p>

<p>We will publish the exam and its solutions a few hours after the exam.</p>

<p>We will publish your grades (via Aula Global) a few working days after the
exam.</p>
